# Test Driven Development (TDD)
## What is it and what is the high level process?

- Test Driven Development (TDD) is a development style/practice in which the tests dictate or drive development.
- In *general*, TDD follows these steps:

1. Write a unit test
1. Run the test (without feature code) to see that it fails
1. Write the code necessary for the test to pass.
1. Refactor the code.
