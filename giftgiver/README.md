### A little project to practice Jest/Enzyme :)

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
### What is it and what is the high level process?

- Test Driven Development (TDD) is a development style/practice in which the tests dictate or drive development.
- In *general*, TDD follows these steps:

1. Write a unit test
1. Run the test (without feature code) to see that it fails
1. Write the code necessary for the test to pass.
1. Refactor the code. 

## Dev commands
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
